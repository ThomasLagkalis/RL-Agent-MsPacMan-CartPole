# Reinforcement Learning agents for Cart Pole and Ms Pac Man  
The primary objective of this report is to explore the capabilities and behaviors of Q-Learning and DQN agents within two distinct environments: the Cart Pole and Pac-Man. .

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 
- Gymnasium
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- moviepy
- tensorflow

## Usage 

After you have installed all dependencies you can either download the .zip file manualy from GitHub or clone the repo with this command:

```console 
git clone https://github.com/ThomasLagkalis/RL-Agent-MsPacMan-CartPole.git
```

For now in order to run the specify which agant to run you have to edit the driver_code.py. 

```console 
python3 driver_code.py
```

If you want to edit the hyperparameters you can find them in drive_code.py and agent.py. In future commits will add feature selection with args.

## Results 

After you run the programm the results i.e. the graphs and an inscance of the agent navigating the environment are saved in ./visual
